"""
A basic template file for using the Model class in PicoLibrary
This will allow you to implement simple Statemodels with some basic
event-based transitions.

Currently supports only 4 buttons (hardcoded to BTN1 through BTN4)
and a TIMEOUT event for internal tranisitions.

For processing your own events such as sensors, you can implement
those in your run method for transitions based on sensor events.

# Import whatever Library classes you need - Model is obviously needed

"""
This is the template Model Runner - you should rename this class to something
that is supported by your class diagram. This should associate with your other
classes, and any PicoLibrary classes. If you are using Buttons, you will implement
buttonPressed and buttonReleased.

To implement the model, you will need to implement 3 methods to support entry actions,
exit actions, and state actions.

This template currently implements a very simple state model that uses a button to
transition from state 0 to state 1 then a 5 second timer to go back to state 0.
